# Desktop Icon Assets

Place platform-specific application icons in this directory when preparing a release build.
Tauri looks for PNG/ICNS/ICO assets during bundling, but we avoid committing the generated
binary artwork to keep the repository lightweight. Refer to the release checklist for the
expected dimensions and formats before running `tauri build`.
